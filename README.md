# Simple Python translation script for RMD-X Bionic Motors
This is a simple Python script that generates messages for the RMD-X Bionic Motor's CAN protocol. This is a WIP repository so feel free to contribute if you find any issues or have anything to add.

# Note
Please be careful as in the documentation, there are multiple lines that are lost in translation. Additionally, note that some CAN commands use the generic 0x7FF identifier and some will use the motor ID. The script will not necessarily reflect that (yet) so please refer to the documentation for the correct identifier.
